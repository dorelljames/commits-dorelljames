I created this site to start documenting my experiences about all the stuff I'm working on. Today, I'm still not so sure about whether this is a good thing or not but hey, I'm putting it out here anyways. As a monument to getting started, you'll find above the very first screenshot of this site. Stay tuned for more updates!
