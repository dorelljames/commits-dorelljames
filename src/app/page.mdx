## HubSpot Integration {{ date: '2024-10-10T00:45:18.135Z' }}

Today I added a HubSpot integration to the site. This will allow me to keep track of people who sign up for updates. As I start in this journey, I want to be able to keep track of all the people who are interested in what I'm doing.

I created this site to start documenting my experiences about all the stuff I'm working on. Today, I'm still not so sure about whether this is a good thing or not but hey, I'm putting it out here anyways. As a monument to getting started, you'll find above the very first screenshot of this site. Stay tuned for more updates!
