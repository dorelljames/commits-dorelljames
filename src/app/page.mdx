### Exploring PWAs for a Better User Experience with Cebby!

Yesterday morning, I dove into an experiment with Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) to scratch a personal itchâ€”creating a smoother, more reliable experience for Cebby users in the future.

Why not just stick with a regular web app? ðŸ¤” Hereâ€™s the thing: imagine youâ€™re at an event, reaching for your phone to pull up the event info or scan a QR code (especially because someone asked for it ðŸ˜…). We all try to prepare by taking screenshots or saving details in advance, but thatâ€™s not really the experience we deserve, is it?

### A Web App Isnâ€™t Enoughâ€¦ Hereâ€™s Why:

With a traditional web app, youâ€™re constantly tethered to the internet. And here in the Philippines, consistent, stable mobile data isnâ€™t something we can always count on. Plus, creating a dedicated mobile app for Cebby would just add another app on peopleâ€™s phones that might not get used often. So, why not meet users halfway?

Thatâ€™s where a PWA comes in. Itâ€™s a website with all the reliability, offline capabilities, and functionality of a native mobile appâ€”without the extra downloads or dependency on internet access.

### The User Experience Iâ€™m Envisioning:

1. Open Cebby â€“ Just like a website, but it loads instantly.
2. Browse Events â€“ Check out upcoming events, and RSVP directly or follow a link to the hostâ€™s ticket page.
3. Store Essential Assets â€“ Important assets like QR codes or event details save to your device, so you have everything you need, even offline.
   At the Event: When you arrive, you can launch Cebby, pull up the event details or QR code without internet, and youâ€™re all set!

This is the kind of experience I want to create for Cebby users: a platform that works reliably anytime, anywhere, and frees users from data worries. Because good design cares about what you need, before you even realize it.

Letâ€™s make Cebby a reliable companion for every event, no matter where you are! ðŸš€

## Subcribe To Calendar Updates {{ date: '2024-10-30T22:46:35.894Z' }}

![](@/images/subscribe-to-calendar-updates.png)

Added capability to subscribe to calendar updates so that you can get notified when there are new events straight to your calendar. This works for Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCal.

See latest commit [here](https://github.com/dorelljames/event-ni/commit/749a2ea44466517b2ef9fe24b507abdbbd246b54)

## Quicky spin up hacktoberfest.jscebu.org! {{ date: '2024-10-24T02:49:20.670Z' }}

Yesterday, I just couldn't help myself but to spin up a Hacktoberfest website for the JavaScript Cebu community. And boy, I did! It took me a couple of hours but I'm glad I was able to do it.

Now and moving forward, the time and effort by community members will be monumented here.

Check it out at [hacktoberfest.jscebu.org](https://hacktoberfest.jscebu.org)

Accepting also contributions for the website itself! [See the repo here](https://github.com/javascriptcebu/hacktoberfest.jscebu.org)

## Meta Business Verification {{ date: '2024-10-22T11:31:12.626Z' }}

![](@/images/meta-business-verification.png)

Asked a few friends in the community to help test the app. I already had a hint that the FB App might need to be verified and so indeed. I am patiently waiting for the review so I can proceed with the next steps.

After this, I also need to apply for `Access Verification` (you could see it in the screenshot above).

I don't think I'll update the web app anytime soon. I'm going back to focus on the backend and fix some issues and improve some areas that I think needs to be improved. A couple of things that I want to do:

1. **Fix the attribution of events to the correct account**
2. **Support for multiple accounts for a given event**
3. **Probably switch to database functions instead of edge functions for the automated initiating process**

That's it for now. See yah!

One step closer to getting everything automated for the Facebook Events service of this events aggregator that I'm building.

## Tech Events Aggregator Automated Service {{ date: '2024-10-19T06:24:48.096Z' }}

I have successfully completed the Event Aggregation service, which currently fetches events from Facebook based on the accounts stored in the database. While serverless functions are familiar to me, Supabase's choice of Deno as their runtime provided a valuable learning opportunity.

The service operates on a 15-minute schedule, checking for new events and saving them to the database using the `pg_cron` and `pg_net` extensions. The cron job triggers a Supabase edge function to fetch events from Facebook, and for each account, it calls the edge function to retrieve and store the events in the database.

## Tech Events Calendar {{ date: '2024-10-17T02:28:37.105Z' }}

I finally had the time to work on this idea of mind, an aggregation of tech events in Cebu.

There's two parts of this project:

1. **Event Aggregation**: This service automates the process of fetching the events from sources, eg: Facebook, Eventbrite, Meetup, etc. It then stores the events in a database and makes them available via an API.
2. **Web App**: This is a simple web app to view the events. It allows you to filter the events by category, date, and location. It's public and will allow people to see the events in Cebu as well as organizers to authorize (in Facebook's case) their apps to sync their events to the site.

## HubSpot Integration {{ date: '2024-10-10T00:45:18.135Z' }}

Today I added a HubSpot integration to the site. This will allow me to keep track of people who sign up for updates. As I start in this journey, I want to be able to keep track of all the people who are interested in what I'm doing.

## The beginning {{ date: '2024-10-09T01:38:10.143Z' }}

I created this site to start documenting my experiences about all the stuff I'm working on. Today, I'm still not so sure about whether this is a good thing or not but hey, I'm putting it out here anyways. As a monument to getting started, you'll find above the very first screenshot of this site. Stay tuned for more updates!
