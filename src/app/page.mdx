## Meta Business Verification {{ date: '2024-10-22T11:31:12.626Z' }}

![](@/images/meta-business-verification.png)

Asked a few friends in the community to help test the app. I already had a hint that the FB App might need to be verified and so indeed. I am patiently waiting for the review so I can proceed with the next steps.

After this, I also need to apply for `Access Verification` (you could see it in the screenshot above).

I don't think I'll update the web app anytime soon. I'm going back to focus on the backend and fix some issues and improve some areas that I think needs to be improved. A couple of things that I want to do:

1. **Fix the attribution of events to the correct account**
2. **Support for multiple accounts for a given event**
3. **Probably switch to database functions instead of edge functions for the automated initiating process**

That's it for now. See yah!

One step closer to getting everything automated for the Facebook Events service of this events aggregator that I'm building.

## Tech Events Aggregator Automated Service {{ date: '2024-10-19T06:24:48.096Z' }}

I have successfully completed the Event Aggregation service, which currently fetches events from Facebook based on the accounts stored in the database. While serverless functions are familiar to me, Supabase's choice of Deno as their runtime provided a valuable learning opportunity.

The service operates on a 15-minute schedule, checking for new events and saving them to the database using the `pg_cron` and `pg_net` extensions. The cron job triggers a Supabase edge function to fetch events from Facebook, and for each account, it calls the edge function to retrieve and store the events in the database.

## Tech Events Calendar {{ date: '2024-10-17T02:28:37.105Z' }}

I finally had the time to work on this idea of mind, an aggregation of tech events in Cebu.

There's two parts of this project:

1. **Event Aggregation**: This service automates the process of fetching the events from sources, eg: Facebook, Eventbrite, Meetup, etc. It then stores the events in a database and makes them available via an API.
2. **Web App**: This is a simple web app to view the events. It allows you to filter the events by category, date, and location. It's public and will allow people to see the events in Cebu as well as organizers to authorize (in Facebook's case) their apps to sync their events to the site.

## HubSpot Integration {{ date: '2024-10-10T00:45:18.135Z' }}

Today I added a HubSpot integration to the site. This will allow me to keep track of people who sign up for updates. As I start in this journey, I want to be able to keep track of all the people who are interested in what I'm doing.

## The beginning {{ date: '2024-10-09T01:38:10.143Z' }}

I created this site to start documenting my experiences about all the stuff I'm working on. Today, I'm still not so sure about whether this is a good thing or not but hey, I'm putting it out here anyways. As a monument to getting started, you'll find above the very first screenshot of this site. Stay tuned for more updates!
